        <h3>
        One of the most important characteristics of leaders, 
         and the most successful people in every area of life is 
            that they know who they are, what they believe in, 
            and what they stand for. Most people are confused about their 
            goals, values, and ideas, and as a result, they go back 
            and forth and accomplish very little. Men and women who become leaders, 
            on the other hand, with the same or even fewer abilities and opportunities,
            go on to great accomplishments in whatever they attempt.
            </h3>

A paragraph is a number of sentences grouped together and relating to one topic. 
Or, a group of related sentences that develop a single point.This 
definitionshows that the paragraphs of compositions are not mere arbitrary divisions. 
<u>The division of a chapter into paragraphs must be made according to the changes of ideas introduced.
There is, therefore, no rule as to the length of a paragraph.</u> It may be short 
or long according to the necessity of the case. A paragraph may consist of a single 
sentence or of many sentences.
